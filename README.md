   - Cost calculation per message and conversation
   - Credit-based system for usage control
   - Detailed usage statistics display

5. **Chat Management**

   - Persistent chat history with PostgreSQL storage
   - Chat branching support for conversation exploration
   - Pinned conversations for quick access
   - Custom chat titles with user override capability
   - Chat deletion and organization

6. **Advanced UI Features**

   - Markdown rendering with GitHub Flavored Markdown support
   - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Mathematical equation rendering with KaTeX
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Dark mode support with theme persistence
